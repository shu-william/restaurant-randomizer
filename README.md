# Restaurant Randomizer
A web application that draws from Yelp's Fusion third-party API to retrieve a list of restaurants which users can filter through, add to their favorites, and select a random restaurant from the filtered list to decide what to eat. For my fellow indecisive eaters.

## Product Backlog
- Consider adding filters in favorites list, or a 'sort by' option (optional)
- Adjust Yelp API calls to retrieve all relevant data as opposed to in groups of 20 (optional, would result in more calls used per search)
- Adjust CSS layout to accommodate excess white space
- Add loading icon when waiting to fetch API data

## Known bugs/issues
- Borders do not fit the entire screen on all media sizes
- Location services button is not fully covered on all media sizes
