# Restaurant Randomizer
A web application that draws from Yelp's Fusion third-party API to retrieve a list of restaurants which users can filter through, add to their favorites, and select a random restaurant from the filtered list to decide what to eat. For my fellow indecisive eaters.

## Product Backlog
- Improve front-end design and UI
- Implement location services for precise coordinates and distances
- Add more categories to filter restaurants by. Consider adding filters in favorites list, or a 'sort by' option (optional)
- Adjust Yelp API calls to retrieve all relevant data as opposed to in groups of 20 (optional, would result in more calls used per search)
- Deploy to a hosted web service
