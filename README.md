# Restaurant Randomizer
A web application that draws from a third-party API to retrieve a list of restaurants which users can filter through, and then select a random restaurant from that filtered list to decide what to eat. For my fellow indecisive eaters.

## Product Backlog
- Improve front-end design and UI
- Make buttons change depending on if restaurants are in favorites list.
- Add more categories to filter restaurants by. Consider adding filters in favorites list, or a 'sort by' option
- Adjust Yelp API calls to retrieve all relevant data as opposed to in groups of 20 (optional, would result in more calls used per search)
