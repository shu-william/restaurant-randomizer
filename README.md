# Restaurant Randomizer
A web application that draws from a third-party API to retrieve a list of restaurants which users can filter through, and then select a random restaurant from that filtered list to decide what to eat. For my fellow indecisive eaters.

## Product Backlog

- Improve front-end design and UI
- Incorporate Yelp Developer assets with links to restaurants on Yelp
- Make "pick a random restaurant" function prettier when executed

- Add pagination so users can scroll through more restaurants than the 20 displayed
