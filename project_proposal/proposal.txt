Restaurant Randomizer

Description: 
	By completion, I would like this project to draw from a third-party API that has a database of restaurants including location at a minimum, and ideally also including cuisine type, cost, reviews, and other details such as when using Yelp. A user would be able to, without needing to log in, filter for restaurants that fit their criteria, and then click a "Random Restaurant" button that brings up a random selection from the filtered list. Logged-in users would be able to add restaurants to a favorites list. The point of this project is to demonstrate an ability to create an application similar to that of Yelp, while also adding the randomizer functionality for users who may be indecisive when choosing what to eat.

Stack: JavaScript/MERN

Features:
	Login/registration for users who want to add restaurants to a favorites list
